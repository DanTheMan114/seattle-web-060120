# Welcome to Intro to CSS Grids and Flexboxes!

After this session, students should be able to...

-   Define a grid
-   Move elements around the grid using various different CSS instructions
-   Define a flexbox
-   Move stuff around inside of a flexbox
-   Think critically about how to debug a CSS problem
-   Reflect upon the nuanced changes to the human experience, from the invention of simple tools to combat the frustration of a hunter or gatherer, to yourself, repeatedly typing `border: 1px solid red;` to combat the frustration of the intangible reality of computer programming. Are our fears the same?
